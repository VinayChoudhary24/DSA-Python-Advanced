## STACK:: Stacks are linear Data structures. the store data in 1-dimensional format.
           ==> Stacks follow LIFO. (Last in First out)

           ==> Insertion Operation in Stacks is called PUSH.
           ==> Removing Operation is Stacks is called POP.

## USE CASES::
             1. In Recursion we have callStack for function calls which is a direct application of it.
             2. Navigatoin Implementation i.e when screens are getting stacked and we try to go back the last screen
                added is removed and so on.
             3. Complex Arithematic Operations.
             4. Features like Undo and Redo.


###Question
Which data structure is used for implementing recursion?

Answer:
Stack, Recursion involves function calls and each function call needs to store:
       1. the return address (where to go back after the function call completes)
       2. local variables of the function
       3. parameters passed to the function
       4. the system uses a call stack to handle this automatically


## Why do we need stacks::
                        1. Stacks put restrictions/limit that when a function call completes it will only call
                           the function added to stack before it. when we want to restict, we can use it.
                        2. to solve complex arithematic ops with parenthesis etc...



## Implementing Stacks using List::
                                 1. Storage
                                 2. Restriction mechanism, list should only use append function to insert and when we
                                    want to access data it should be only from the top of it i.e one side only not both 
                                    and  there should be no random access in between also. 
                                 3. Top Variable, we introduce a Top Variable which always keeps the value of the 
                                    Last Index for access and no one can access any other data than the data in Top
                                    Variable.
                                 4. Peek() Function, introduce a peek function that only gives access to Top Variable.
                                 5. This mechanism of Top variable and Peek Function, Forces LIFO.

###Question
Which of the following operation take  Constant time (O(1)) in the array implementation of stack?

Answer:
Push = O(1), adds at top

Pop = O(1), removes at top

Peek = O(1), access top element

isEmpty and isFull = O(1), simple comparison operations.    



## Implementing Stacks using Linked List::       
                                    1. In LL we Insert at the head and remove from head because it is O(1).
                                    2. In LL head represents the Top Variable.
                                    3. Implement of Stack using LL is better Approach than Stack using Lists/array
                                       because LL has better space complexity and the append operation is O(1) in
                                       most cases but can go to O(n) in worst case. whereas LL adding at head operation
                                       O(1) even in worst cases.


# Example of Implementing Stack using LL

class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize LL
        self.__ll = LinkedList()

    def push(self, data):
        self.__ll.add_at_head(data)

    def pop(self):
        if self.__ll.isEmpty():
            print("Stack is empty")
            return
        self.__ll.remove_at_head()

    def peek(self):
        if self.__ll.isEmpty():
            print("Stack is empty")
            return
        return self.__ll.get_head()

st.push(10)
st.push(12)

# remove

###Question
Implement Stack using Singly LL

Implement a Stack Data Structure specifically to store integer data using a Singly Linked List.

The data members should be private.

You need to implement the following public functions :

1. Constructor:
It initialises the data members as required.

2. push(data) :
This function should take one argument of type integer. It pushes the element into the stack and returns nothing.

3. pop() :
It pops the element from the top of the stack and in turn, returns the element being popped or deleted. In case the stack is empty, it returns -1.

4. top :
It returns the element being kept at the top of the stack. In case the stack is empty, it returns -1.

5. size() :
It returns the size of the stack at any given instance of time.

6. isEmpty() :
It returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack is empty or not.

Operations Performed on the Stack:
Query-1(Denoted by an integer 1): Pushes an integer data to the stack.

Query-2(Denoted by an integer 2): Pops the data kept at the top of the stack and returns it to the caller.

Query-3(Denoted by an integer 3): Fetches and returns the data being kept at the top of the stack but doesn't remove it, 
unlike the pop function.

Query-4(Denoted by an integer 4): Returns the current size of the stack.

Query-5(Denoted by an integer 5): Returns a boolean value denoting whether the stack is empty or not.

Answer:
class Node :

    def __init__(self, data) :

## BALANCED PARENTHESES:: MOST IMP
             ==> A Expression is called balanced if it has Balancing opening and Closing parentheses.

          *****Important properties to remember for problem solving::  
             1. if we have a balanced expression and we wrap that complete expression in a opening and closing
                parentheses than the resulting expression is also balanced. 
                            (a + b) + c ===>> ( (a + b) + c)

             2. if we have 2 balanced parentheses expressions and we concatenate them and the resulting expression is 
                also balanced.
                             (a + b) + c & (c + d) ===>> ( (a + b) + c) (c + d)   
   
                     *****Expected to do::
                      1. we have to find that the given Expression is balanced or not.

                     *****Process::
                             1. we want access of an opening parentheses , JUST BEFORE the closing one to balance it out.

                             2. we use stacks, we only store the opening parentheses in stack for a given expression.
                             3. when we encounter a Closing Parentheses we check for:
                                    i-- do we have a access to a opening parentheses in stack that can balance it out.
                                    ii-- if the stack is empty and we dont have any opening parentheses to balance it,
                                         this means the expression is not balanced and we return False.
                                    iii-- the expression iteration is completed and the stack is not empty i.e there are
                                          some or one opening parentheses in stack. we return False.    


## Example 

def isBalanced(expression):
    if len(expression) == 0:
        return False
    st= []
    # iterate over expression
    for i in range(len(expression)):
        # check and add the opening parentheses in stack
        if expression[i] == "(":
            st.append("(")
        # if closing parentheses
        elif expression[i] == ")":
            # if no parentheses in stack 
            if len(st) == 0:
                return False
            # check in stack if opening parentheses on top
            if st[len(st) - 1] == "(":
                # we found a opening parentheses to balance the closing parentheses
                st.pop()

    # once the loop is over on expression we check if there are still opening parentheses present in stack or not
    return len(st) == 0

isBalanced("((a + b) + a)(c + b)")

True



###Question
Check if the Brackets are balanced

For a given a string expression containing only round brackets or parentheses, check if they are balanced or not. 
Brackets are said to be balanced if the bracket which opens last, closes first.

Answer:
def isBalanced(expression):
    if len(expression) == 0:
        return False
    st= []
    # iterate over expression
    for i in range(len(expression)):
        # check and add the opening parentheses in stack
        if expression[i] == "(":
            st.append("(")
        # if closing parentheses
        elif expression[i] == ")":
            # if no parentheses in stack 
            if len(st) == 0:
                return False
            # check in stack if opening parentheses on top
            if st[len(st) - 1] == "(":
                # we found a opening parentheses to balance the closing parentheses
                st.pop()

    # once the loop is over on expression we check if there are still opening parentheses present in stack or not
    return len(st) == 0

isBalanced("((a + b) + a)(c + b)")

True




## REVERSE A STACK USING A STACK:: 



###Question
Reverse a Stack

You have been given two stacks that can store integers as the data. Out of the two given stacks, one is populated 
and the other one is empty. You are required to write a function that reverses the populated stack using the one 
which is empty.

Answer:


def isStackEmpty(stack):
    return len(stack) == 0

"""
    Reverses a stack using recursion and an auxiliary stack.

    Strategy: For each element, we recursively reverse the remaining stack,
    then insert the current element at the bottom.
"""
def reverseStack(inputStack, extraStack):
    # Base Case: If the stack is empty, nothing to reverse
    if isStackEmpty(inputStack):
        return

    # Step 1: Remove and store the top element
    # This element will be placed at the bottom after reversing the rest    
    top_element = inputStack.pop() # remove the top element and store it

    # Step 2: Recursive call - reverse the remaining stack
    # Recursive Assumption: This will reverse all elements below top_element
    reverseStack(inputStack, extraStack)

    # Step 3: Self Work - Insert top_element at the bottom of the reversed stack
    # To do this, we need to temporarily move all elements out of the way
    # Transfer all elements from inputStack to extraStack
    # This empties inputStack so we can place top_element at the bottom
    while not isStackEmpty(inputStack):
        element = inputStack.pop() # Remove from input
        extraStack.append(element) # Add to extra (temporary storage)

    # Place the original top element at the bottom of inputStack
    inputStack.append(top_element)

    # Move all elements back from extraStack to inputStack
    # This places them on top of top_element, maintaining their reversed order
    while not isStackEmpty(extraStack):
        # transfer remaing elements from extraStack to inputStack
        element = extraStack.pop() # Remove from extra
        inputStack.append(element) # Add back to input

inputStack = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
extraStack = []

print("Original Stack:", inputStack)

reverseStack(inputStack, extraStack)

print("Reversed Stack:", inputStack)

Original Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed Stack: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]




## NEXT GREATER ELEMENT::

                  Goal: For each element, find the next element to its right that is greater

                  Key Idea: Use a stack to remember indices of elements that haven't found their 
                            "next greater element" yet

                  Direction: Traverse array from left to right (0 to n-1)

 INCREASING Graph Sequence (elements getting larger)
                     1. Easy case - the answer is immediately available!
                     2. When we move from index i to i+1 and arr[i+1] > arr[i]:
                           Element at index i+1 is the next greater element for element at index i
                           We can directly store arr[i+1] at result[i]


 DECRESING Graph Sequence (elements getting Smaller)
                     1. Waiting game - elements must wait for their answer
                     2. When arr[i+1] < arr[i] (next element is smaller):
                          We can't find the answer yet for element at index i
                          We push index i onto the stack to remember it
                          These indices are "waiting" for a greater element

 TRANSITION: Decreasing → Increasing (The Resolution!)
                       now When We Hit an Increasing Point:
                            1. We encounter element which is greater than previous elements
                            2. Now we check the stack - it has indices of elements waiting for an answer
                            3. Pop from stack and resolve all waiting elements:
                                    Pop index and check: is arr[current] > arr[popped_index]?
                                    If YES: result[popped_index] = arr[current] ✓
                                    Continue until stack is empty OR stack top has a larger value and return -1.




###Question
You have been given an array/list ‘ARR’ consisting of ‘N’ positive integers. Your task is to return the Next Greater 
Element(NGE) for every element.

The Next Greater Element for an element ‘X’ is the first element on the right side of ‘X’ in the array 'ARR', 
which is greater than ‘X’. If no such element exists to the right of ‘X’, then return -1.

Answer:
def isStackEmpty(stack):
    return len(stack) == 0

# For each element, find the first element to its right that is greater.
# If no such element exists, return -1.
# Uses a stack-based approach for O(n) time and space complexity.
def next_greater(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Initialize output array with -1 (default when no greater element exists)
    output = [-1] * n

    # Stack stores indices of array elements (not the values themselves)
    st = []

    # Push the first index onto the stack
    st.append(0)

    # Iterate through the array starting from index 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        # While stack is not empty AND current element is greater than 
        # the element at the index stored at top of stack
        while not isStackEmpty(st) and arr[i] > arr[st[len(st) - 1]]:
            # Current element (arr[i]) is the next greater element 
            # for the element at index st[top]
            output[st[len(st) - 1]] = arr[i]
            # Remove the index from stack as we found its next greater element
            st.pop()
        # Push current index onto stack to find its next greater element later
        st.append(i)

    # Elements still in stack have no next greater element (remain -1)
    return output

next_greater([1, 3, 5, 8, 3, 4, 7, 10])

[3, 5, 8, 10, 4, 7, 10, -1]

              Stock Span, span of the stock is the no. of consecutive days before the current day for which price
                          was lesser than current day.

###Question
Stock Span

Amit has been working with an organization called 'Money Traders' for the past few years. The organization is into 
the money trading business. His manager assigned him a task. For a given array/list of stock's prices for N days, 
find the stock's span for each day.

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days(starting from today and 
going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than today's price.

Explanation:
For the stock prices [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], the span of each day is calculated by counting consecutive 
previous days with a price less than or equal to today's price:

Day 1 (100): No previous days, span = 1.
Day 2 (80): Less than 100, span = 1.
Day 3 (60): Less than 80, span = 1.
Day 4 (70): Greater than 60, span = 2.
Day 5 (60): Less than 70, span = 1.
Day 6 (75): Greater than 60, 70, and 60, span = 4.
Day 7 (85): Greater than all previous days, span = 6.
Final spans: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

                    1. we need to calculate the amount of water trapped between buildings
                    2. to calculate the amount for (i)th building, we can calculate the previous greater and the
                       next greater building.
                    3. we can maintain two arrays:
                                       ==> TL(Left to Right), represents the previous buildings
                                       ==> TR(Right to Left), represents the previous buildings

Pop2 = "2" (second operand)
Create: "(" + "5" + "/" + "2" + ")" = "(5/2)"
Push "(5/2)"


Stack: ["6", "(5/2)"]

Step 5: See - (operator)

Action:

Pop1 = "(5/2)" (first operand)
Pop2 = "6" (second operand)
Create: "(" + "(5/2)" + "-" + "6" + ")" = "((5/2)-6)"
Push "((5/2)-6)"


Stack: ["((5/2)-6)"]

Step 6: See 3 (operand)

Action: Push "3"
Stack: ["((5/2)-6)", "3"]

Step 7: See 2 (operand)

Action: Push "2"
Stack: ["((5/2)-6)", "3", "2"]

Step 8: See / (operator)

Action:

Pop1 = "2" (first operand)
Pop2 = "3" (second operand)
Create: "(" + "2" + "/" + "3" + ")" = "(2/3)"
Push "(2/3)"


Stack: ["((5/2)-6)", "(2/3)"]

Step 9: See 5 (operand)

Action: Push "5"
Stack: ["((5/2)-6)", "(2/3)", "5"]

Step 10: See - (operator)

Action:

Pop1 = "5" (first operand)
Pop2 = "(2/3)" (second operand)
Create: "(" + "5" + "-" + "(2/3)" + ")" = "(5-(2/3))"
Push "(5-(2/3))"


Stack: ["((5/2)-6)", "(5-(2/3))"]

Step 11: See * (operator)

Action:

Pop1 = "(5-(2/3))" (first operand)
Pop2 = "((5/2)-6)" (second operand)
Create: "(" + "(5-(2/3))" + "*" + "((5/2)-6)" + ")" = "((5-(2/3))*((5/2)-6))"
