# Data Structures & Interview Questions

A comprehensive collection of data structures implementations and industry-standard interview questions to help you ace technical interviews.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository contains detailed explanations, implementations, and interview questions for the following data structures:

### 1. Stacks

- **Concept**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure
- **Common Interview Questions**:
  - Implement a stack using arrays/linked lists
  - Valid parentheses problem
  - Next greater element
  - Min stack (retrieve minimum element in O(1))
  - Evaluate postfix/prefix expressions
  - Stock span problem

### 2. Queues

- **Concept**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure
- **Common Interview Questions**:
  - Implement queue using stacks
  - Circular queue implementation
  - Priority queue operations
  - Sliding window maximum
  - Generate binary numbers from 1 to n
  - First non-repeating character in a stream

### 3. Binary Trees

- **Concept**: Hierarchical tree structure with each node having at most two children
- **Common Interview Questions**:
  - Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)
  - Maximum depth/height of binary tree
  - Diameter of binary tree
  - Check if two trees are identical
  - Mirror/invert a binary tree
  - Lowest common ancestor (LCA)
  - Path sum problems
  - Serialize and deserialize binary tree

### 4. Binary Search Trees (BST)

- **Concept**: Binary tree with left child ≤ parent ≤ right child property
- **Common Interview Questions**:
  - Validate BST
  - Search, insert, and delete operations
  - Find kth smallest/largest element
  - Convert sorted array to BST
  - Inorder successor/predecessor
  - Check if BST is balanced
  - Recover/correct a BST
  - Range sum of BST

### 5. Generic Trees (N-ary Trees)

- **Concept**: Tree structure where nodes can have any number of children
- **Common Interview Questions**:
  - N-ary tree level order traversal
  - Maximum depth of N-ary tree
  - Serialize and deserialize N-ary tree
  - Diameter of N-ary tree
  - N-ary tree preorder/postorder traversal
  - Lowest common ancestor in N-ary tree

### 6. Hashing & Dictionary

- **Concept**: Key-value data structure for O(1) average-case lookup
- **Common Interview Questions**:
  - Two sum problem
  - Group anagrams
  - First unique character
  - Subarray sum equals K
  - Longest substring without repeating characters
  - Implement LRU cache
  - Design HashMap
  - Find duplicate in array
  - Top K frequent elements
